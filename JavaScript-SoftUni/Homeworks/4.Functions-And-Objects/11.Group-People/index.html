    Problem 11.	*** Group Persons

    Write a JavaScript function group(persons) that groups an array of persons
    by age, first or last name. Create a Person constructor to add every person
    in the person array. The group(persons) function must return an associative
    array, with keys – the groups (age, firstName and lastName) and values –
    arrays with persons in this group. Print on the console every entry of the
    returned associative array. Use function overloading (i.e. just one function).
    You may need to find how to use constructors.
