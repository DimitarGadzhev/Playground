   Problem 5. Division by 3
   Write a JavaScript function divisionBy3(value) that finds the sum of
   digits of integer number n (n > 9) and checks if the sum is divided
   by 3 without remainder. Write JS program divisionChecker.js to check
   a few numbers. The result should be printed on the console
   (“the number is divided by 3 without remainder” or “the number is not
   divided by 3 without remainder”). Run the program through Node.js.
