   Problem 9. Tree or House
   Write a JavaScript function treeHouseCompare(value) that accepts the following
   parameters: integers a and b. The function compares the area of the house and
   the area of the tree (Figure 1) and returns the name of the figure with bigger
   area (house or tree) and the value of the area. Write JS program treehouse.js
   that compares a few houses and trees. The result should be printed on the console.
   Run the program through Node.js.
