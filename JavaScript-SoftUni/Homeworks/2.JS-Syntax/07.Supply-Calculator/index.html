   Problem 7. The Lifetime Supply Calculator
   Write a JavaScript function calcSupply(value) that accepts the
   following parameters: your age, your maximum age, estimate amount
   of your favorite food per day (as a number). The function calculates
   how many of the food you will eat for the rest of your life. Write JS
   program lifetimeSupplyCalc.js that calculates the amount of a few foods
   that you will eat. The result should be printed on the console. Run the
   program through Node.js. Note: we assume that there are no leap years.
