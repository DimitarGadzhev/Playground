// Problem 10. Join Lists
// Write a program that takes as input two lists of integers 
// and joins them. The result should hold all numbers from the 
// first list, and all numbers from the second list, without 
// repeating numbers, and arranged in increasing order. The 
// input and output lists are given as integers, separated 
// by a space, each list at a separate line.
