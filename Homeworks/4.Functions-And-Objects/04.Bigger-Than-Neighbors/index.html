    Problem 4. Bigger Than Neighbors

    Write a JavaScript function biggerThanNeighbors(index,  arr) that accept a
    number and an integer array as parameters. The function should return a Boolean
    number: whether the element at the given position in the array is bigger than
    its two neighbors (when such exist). It should return undefined when the index
    doesn't exist. Write a JS program that invokes the function with the sample data
    below and prints the result at the console following the samples in the task.
