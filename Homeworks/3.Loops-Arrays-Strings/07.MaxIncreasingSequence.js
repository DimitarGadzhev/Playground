/*  Problem 7. Maximal Increasing Sequence
    Write a JavaScript function findMaxSequence(value) that finds the maximal increasing
    sequence in an array of numbers and returns the result as an array. If there is no
    increasing sequence the function returns 'no'.

    Write JS program maxSequenceFinder.js that invokes your function with the sample
    input data below and prints the output at the console.  */
