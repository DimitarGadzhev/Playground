/*  Problem 8. Sort Array
    Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
    Write a JavaScript function sortArray(value) to sort an array. Use the
    "selection sort" algorithm: find the smallest element, move it at the first
    position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.
    Write JS program arraySorter.js that invokes your function with the sample input
    data below and prints the output at the console. Use a second array. */

/* Example
Input	                                    Output
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]	                            1, 2, 3, 4, 5
[12, 12, 50, 2, 6, 22, 51, 712, 6, 3, 3]	2, 3, 3, 6, 6, 12, 12, 22, 50, 51, 712
