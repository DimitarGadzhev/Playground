    Write a JavaScript function findMostFreqNum(value) that finds the most frequent
    number in an array. If multiple numbers appear the same maximal number of times,
    print the leftmost of them. Write JS program numberFinder.js that invokes your
    function with the sample input data below and prints the output at the console.  */
