/*  Problem 6. Maximal Sequence
    Write a JavaScript function findMaxSequence(value) that finds the maximal
    sequence of equal elements in an array and returns the result as an array.
    If there is more than one sequence with the same maximal length, print the
    rightmost one. Write JS program sequenceFinder.js that invokes your function
    with the sample input data below and prints the output at the console.  */

/*
Input	                          Output
[2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1]	  [2, 2, 2]
['happy']	                      ['happy']
