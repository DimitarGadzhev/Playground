   Familiarize yourself with Microsoft Visual Studio (if you already have it installed) or 
   install Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Express) at your laptop or home computer. 
   Search in Internet for the correct download link:
   http://google.com/search?q=download+visual+studio.
   Start Visual Studio and play with it. 
   Create a simple C# program (console application), compile and run it.

   Hello! This is my homework.
   Problem 1 is done, of course. :) 
   I am well familiarized with Visual Studio.

   As you see, I also added some .txt files to the solution.
   You can do this too when you press CTRL+SHIFT+A and choose 
   what kind of item you want to add ;)

   Problem 2. Blank Solution in Visual Studio

   Create a blank solution in Visual Studio called “Intro-Programming-Homework”. 
   This solution will hold all your homework projects, code and files. 
   For each problem (exercises) add a separate project with self-descriptive 
   name like “Hello-World” and “Print-Your-Name”. 

   Yeah, it WAS blank... :D
